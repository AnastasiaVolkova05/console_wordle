# Consol Wordle 

## Instraction
To run the **program**, you need to put all the files from here into one folder and run the file progam.py. The library termcolor works correctly only on Linux, so I advise you to either download Linux ( _For [not MacOs](https://archlinux.org/download/) or to [MacOs](https://asahilinux.org/)_) or run it in an online compiler. If you run the program on an online compiler, then all files should also be in the same folder. In file test there are test of function, that used in main code. If you want to see test run file **test.py**

## Installation libraries

File **requirements.txt** include all libriries that you need to install to run the project.
